Feel free to use this code. It has been extensively tested over at least a year of deployment. This implementation reliably addresses the core challenges involved in reading and sending AT commands to a SIM module. It provides a robust and efficient solution for communicating with the module via a serial port, ensuring stable data transmission and reception in practical applications.
